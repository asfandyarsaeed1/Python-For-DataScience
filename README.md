# Python-For-DataScience
* This repo is populated with a mission to communicate full Python knowledge to a beginner to intermediate.
* I have shared sample data as well for practice.
* I will keep updating it in the future as well
* As per my experience Data Scientists utilize 80% of their time Cleaning the data and then 20 % of their time on model building and Data engineers use 70% of their time on cleaning Data and 30 % on architecture and data modeling.
* By going through these use cases one can have a good idea of what Data Engineers and Data Scientists do all day.
* If DE has these skills he can build better designs and if there is any data Quality issue they can identify the issue within in very short time.
